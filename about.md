I am a graduate student from Albuquerque, New Mexico who is pursuing a [Bachelors of Science in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/academics-admissions/undergraduate-programs/course-6-2-electrical-eng-computer-science) at [MIT](http://web.mit.edu/). I also have a passion for chemistry and mechanical engineering and enjoy working on projects that give me the opportunity to draw from multiple skillsets to explore interesting technologies.

Some of my hobbies include card magic, running, and biking. In my free time, I also enjoy teaching and science education pursuits. During my time as an undergraduate, I helped [MIT Club Chem](http://web.mit.edu/clubchem/www/) put on chemistry demonstrations for the community. I also teach classes such as organic chemistry and introductory electronics to high school students through the [MIT Educational Studies Program (ESP)](https://esp.mit.edu/learn/index.html). In addition, I help run the [MIT Science Olympiad Invitational](https://scioly.mit.edu) each year.

I do read all emails that get sent to me, but due to the all-consuming nature of being a student, I do not always have the chance to respond in a timely manner.
