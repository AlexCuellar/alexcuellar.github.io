I am a undergraduate student from Albuquerque, New Mexico pursuing a [Bachelors of Science in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/academics-admissions/undergraduate-programs/course-6-2-electrical-eng-computer-science) at [MIT](http://web.mit.edu/). I primarily focus in robotics and autonomous systems, and have a passion for solving problems that exists at the edges between fields.  While I specialize in inference and control, I have experience in planning, perception, electronics, and singal processing.  

Some of my hobbies include hiking, creating languages (human not coding), and acting (mostly in student films). I also am a "peer mentor" to freshmen in my living group at MIT.  This means I am specifically trained and designated to be at touchpoint for new students having personal or academic struggles, or just need to talk.  Giving back to a community that I cherish has been among the most important personal experiences of my college career.  

## Contact

Did you find something on here interesting? Found a mistake? Want to give feedback or extend a project? I'd love to hear about it! You can contact me at [alexcuel@mit.edu](mailto:alexcuel@mit.edu). 

I do read all emails that get sent to me, but due to the all-consuming nature of being a student, I do not always have the chance to respond in a timely manner.
