Meet CARl, the autonomous vehicle setup for the labs and final project of the MIT class 6.141 Robotics: Science and Systems.  

CARl has a on onboard CPU, LIDAR, and RGB camera for navigating the world around it.  The class involved several cumulative labs which built from low-level control systems to localization and motion planning.  Our team developed a website with detailed lab writups if you are interested in in depth explanations of our procecess.  However, I will give a high level overview of our process and results here.
